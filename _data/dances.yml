- style: International Ballroom
  description: >
    International ballroom is a style of dance characterized by long, swinging motion
    that follows a "line of dance" counterclockwise around the room. Ballroom dances are
    always with a partner and in the international style partners maintain a closed
    hold&mdash;there are no separations or spins. Figures emphasize motion in the line
    formed by the couple's arms, torso, and legs. Typical attire for performance/competition
    is a full tailsuit for the lead and a gown for the follow.
  dances:
    - name: Slow Waltz
      description: >
        Originating as a folk dance from Austria, waltz is a dance in 3/4 time characterized
        by smooth, gliding motion. The music is typically slow with a heavily accented first beat.
        Many waltz performances and songs are emotional and evocative of love or sadness.

    - name: Tango
      description: >
        Tango originates from Latin countries and has a "march" quality. Usually in 2/4 or 4/4 time,
        tango often looks violent or angry. This quality comes from its sharp, quick qualities which
        are achieved by small controlled motions. Don't give your partner whiplash!

    - name: Foxtrot
      description: >
        Foxtrot is often danced to big band music. This dance allows for a lot of musicality, playing
        with the "slows" and the "quicks" on its many figures. This dance can be intimidating for beginners
        as the "basic" step is a sequence of six figures! Dancing to Sinatra once you've got it all down
        is well worth the effort, though.

    - name: Quickstep
      description: >
        This aptly-named dance is energetic and will get you moving around the floor. This dance appears
        playful and light on the feet though it requires a great amount of physical exertion! Quickstep was
        developed out of the foxtrot and Charleston by Caribbean and African dancers in New York City in the twenties.

    - name: Viennese Waltz
      description: >
        In contrast to the slow waltz, Viennese waltz is danced in 6/8 time and is much faster.
        The international style consists of just seven figures, with most dancers sticking to only three.
        The Viennese Waltz involves a lot of spinning, so take your dizzy pills beforehand! This is almost
        always the dance you'll see in a ballroom in the movies.

- style: American Smooth
  description: >
    American style ballroom (smooth) shares many aspects with the international style, but allows dancers to
    separate into more interesting figures. The swinging motions remain, but dancers can also cross their feet
    and dance "jazzier" moves in place and side-by-side!
  dances:
    - name: Slow Waltz
      description: >
        American slow waltz maintains many of the characteristics of the international style, with the
        added concepts of separated figures and crossing of the feet. This makes things more interesting
        (and also more complicated)!

    - name: Tango
      description: >
        American tango allows the couple to separate for some figures and many of the beginning figures
        follow a "slow, slow, quick quick slow" pattern (easy to remember by spelling "T...A...N-G-O...").

    - name: Foxtrot
      description: >
        The American foxtrot basic step is much easier than the international variety for beginners. The lead steps
        forward twice, then to the side, and repeats going backward. There are a number of easy steps to learn
        beyond the basic as well!

    - name: Viennese Waltz
      description: >
        The American rendition of Viennese Waltz allows for a lot more variety than the international version.
        Dancers may separate and several figures are danced in place without continuing to spin. Recommended
        for those with severe motion sickness!

- style: International Latin
  description: >
    Latin dances are often fast, energetic, and showy. Performers often wear sequined, flashy clothing.
    Latin dances are heavily inspired by traditional music and dances from South America and the Caribbean.
    The music can be very complex which is fun when you've developed an ear for it! Latin dances involve
    a motion in the hips that's hard to learn but fun to use.
  dances:
    - name: Cha Cha
      description: >
        The modern cha cha is the direct result of a music style developed in the 1950s, but has deep
        Afro-Cuban roots. It's also influenced by mambo and this is evident in some of the figures.
        Cha cha dancing is sharp and fast.

    - name: Rumba
      description: >
        Rumba is a romantic dance that plays with closing in and pushing away between the dancers.
        Performances often tell a story and you never know if they'll end in happiness or total anguish!
        The dance is more smooth than cha cha but still has many sharp movements to cut through the more fluid motion.

    - name: Samba
      description: >
        Samba is another dance heavily influenced by West African music and culture. The musical style came out
        of urban Rio de Janeiro and is still the focus of Carnival every year. The dance that's learned and competed
        in international Latin style is a more formalized, limited dance. If you like progressive dances then samba
        is the Latin dance for you! It's the only Latin dance that moves around the floor.

    - name: Jive
      description: >
        Developed from the jitterbug, jive is one of the most strenuous dances out there. The music is rapid and
        dancers constantly lift their legs up high and work their core. This dance has plenty of spins and turns
        as well, so you're in for a ride!

    - name: Paso Doble
      description: >
        Paso doble is a comparatively rare dance learned mostly by competitive Latin dancers. The dance is nearly
        always danced to a rendition of the song Espa&ntilde;a Ca&ntilde;i and mimics a matador (the lead) flourishing
        a cape (the follow). There are several points in the music that reach a dramatic climax, at which point
        dancers choreograph a figure to match. These "highlights" are the subject of much applause!

- style: American Rhythm
  description: >
    American rhythm dance is the answer to the international style. At first glance many of the dances are identical
    to their Latin counterparts. However, the technique differs greatly and the available figures vary.
  dances:
    - name: Cha Cha
      description: >
        American cha cha differs from the international style mainly in the syllabus and the way the music is expressed
        in the dance. While international cha cha depends on dynamic changes in figures, American focuses more on
        the continuous motion of the body.

    - name: Rumba
      description: >
        American rumba differs greatly from international. The basic step is in "slow, quick quick" time and forms a box.
        Many similar figures are danced from this basic, but many maintain the "slow, quick quick" timing which is not
        prominent in the international style.

    - name: East Coast Swing
      description: >
        Comparable to jive from international style, swing is an upbeat, energetic dance with a lot of fun figures.
        Fortunately, the music is much slower! This dance is often done to rock music so it's a chance to jam hard.

    - name: Bolero
      description: >
        Bolero is a 3/4 dance originating in Spain. Visually, it has elements of rumba and waltz. The latter is due
        to its sweeping motion and the rise and fall in the dance. Bolero is most often learned by competitive rhythm
        dancers but can be a great one for beginners if they find the right instructor.

    - name: Mambo
      description: >
        The first mambo was a dance invented in Cuba in the early part of the century. Modern mambo is very similar to salsa
        but danced on the two beat. The dance was standardized to market it to professional studios, since the original dance
        contained no specific basic steps. Despite this, the modern mambo is lively, fun to dance, and entertaining to watch!

- style: Social, Folk, and Traditional
  description: >
    There are a host of dances that aren't formally part of many ballroom competitions or syllabi but that still
    deserve a place on this list! These dances are as fun and technical as any. If you want to step away from the
    familiar world of ballroom and Latin, one of these might be just for you!
  dances:
    - name: West Coast Swing
      description: >
        West Coast Swing has its roots in Lindy Hop as with many other swing dances. This dance has a much smoother
        look to it, however, as a result of the posture held while dancing. Each partner keeps a much lower center
        of gravity and pushes their feet into the floor, making them appear to float at times!

    - name: Hustle
      description: >
        Hustle is a fast dance straight from the disco era. You'll see a ton of spins, turns, and even some flips.
        The dance is often done so that the partners are constantly turning or passing each other. This dance
        is easy to improvise and there's an endless list of figures!

    - name: Salsa
      description: >
        Chances are good that you can find a club near you where people will dance almost strictly salsa for a few
        hours straight. The dance's popularity is due to the ease of the basic step, the number of figures available,
        and the community built around it. People love salsa! Learn the basic and head out to the club. People are
        usually happy to show you a few new moves!

        Zouk is a dance growing like wildfire in popularity. Zouk evolved from dances like lambada, bolero, and samba
        and is characterized by controlled body movement. Lead and follow work closely together in the dance, producing
        motion communicated through the connection.

    - name: Argentine Tango
      description: >
        Argentine tango is very different from its ballroom cousins in both the music and the technique. The Argentine
        version is heavily dependent on lead, follow, and improvisation of flourishes by the follow. The music often
        includes an accordion- or organ-like sound that creeps along similarly to the dance.
