- question: Why aren't there any events this week?
  answer: >
    We have three main venues &mdash;
    The Rogel Ballroom in the Michigan Union,
    The ballroom in the Michigan League,
    and the Pendleton room in the Michigan Union.
    We book these venues as early as possible, sometimes
    up to one year in advance. Despite this effort,
    there are times when one of these venues has been booked by
    another person or group. On rare occasion, all three
    of these venues are unavailable on the same date. Besides
    some holiday weekends, these are the only weekends where
    we typically don't hold any events.
