- question: Why aren't there any club events this week?
  answer: >
    We stick to three main venues due to their size and the quality of the floor for dancing.
    We book our venue calendar as early as possible&mdash;sometimes over a year in advance!
    Despite this, there are some dates when none of our usual rooms are available because others
    have booked weddings, family reunions, and more. If you know any other great venues we'd
    love to consider them!
- question: Why don't we have newer music?
  answer: >
    Public performance of recorded music is strictly protected by publishing rights
    organizations who want their artists to be paid for their work. We're constantly
    looking into ways to have fresh music that's obtained and used as fairly as possible.
    This can be an expensive endeavor if done correctly and is ruinously expensive if we're
    caught doing it incorrectly! If there's a specific song you'd like to hear, let us know
    and we'll try to make it happen.
