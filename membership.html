<p>
    The Ballroom Dance Club is open to everyone who has a passion for dancing! In order
    to participate in the club's activities, you can either join as a member of the club or
    pay as you go when you attend. You're welcome to pay the per-visit cost the first
    couple of visits and then buy a membership when you know you'll be coming more often!
</p>
<p>
    These dues give you free entry to our Level 1 and Level 2 lessons. The lessons are
    intended for beginners and intermediate dancers and are often taught by current members of
    the <a href="http://michiganballroomteam.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">University of Michigan Ballroom Dance Team</a>.
    Dues <strong>do not</strong> cover our Level 3 lessons, which are <strong>$5 per lesson</strong> for both members and non-members. We make an effort
    to bring in more advanced instructors for these lessons and our hope is that they challenge you
    while teaching you a lot to improve your dancing! If there is an instructor you would like us
    to invite to teach, please <a href="mailto:bdc-inquiry@umich.edu">let us know</a>!
