    One of the best things about ballroom dancing is the variety of styles you can do!
    Ballroom dances are split into four categories&mdash;two international styles and two American styles.
    Each style has four or five dances. Some styles have dances with the same name, but the dances
    themselves can be drastically different!
</p>
<p>
    There are plenty of dances that aren't strictly ballroom dances, such as hustle and West Coast swing.
    People often dance these at social events like weddings or clubs. There are also some popular traditional
    and folk dances like the Polka.
