<h2>Membership<small><a name="membership"><sup>&para;</sup></a></small></h2>
<p>
    The Ballroom Dance Club is open to everyone who has a passion for dancing! In order
    to participate in the club's activities, you can either pay a membership fee per the
    table below or pay a per-visit cost of $5. It's common for dancers to pay the per-visit
    cost the first time or two and then buy a membership when they know they'll be coming
    often!
</p>
<p>
    Membership fees cover the cost of our Level 1 and Level 2 lessons. These lessons are
    intended for beginners and intermediate dancers and are often taught by current members of
    the <a href="http://michiganballroomteam.com" rel="nofollow">University of Michigan Ballroom Dance Team</a>.
    Membership does not cover our Level 3 lessons, which are $5 per lesson. We make an effort
    to bring in more advanced instructors for these lessons and our hope is that they challenge you
    while teaching you a lot to improve your dancing! If there is an instructor you would like us
    to invite to teach, please <a href="mailto:bdc-inquiry@umich.edu">let us know</a>!
