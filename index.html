    Welcome to The Ballroom Dance Club! We're an organization in Ann Arbor, Michigan focused on
    teaching and learning many styles of dance from ballroom to Latin to social.
    We encourage you to come to our Sunday lessons and hopefully <a href="#membership">join as a member</a>!

    You can <a href="http://eepurl.com/b0caij" rel="nofollow">join our mailing list</a> to stay in the loop.
    We also post many of our events like workshops and parties to <a href="{{ site.facebook.publisher }}">our Facebook page</a>.
    We hope to see you around soon!
